# Interactive Tutorial For The Linux Command Line Interface (with Bash!)

## Intro
After see how effective interactive tutorials have been for every other interpereted language I decided it's finally time for Bash to have it's turn. Why shouldn't there be an interactive tutorial for teaching people how to use Bash. And since most people first encounter Bash when trying to learn the Linux command line we can teach them that at the same time.

## How to use
Run the `start_tutorial.sh` script to bring up the tutorial shell.
